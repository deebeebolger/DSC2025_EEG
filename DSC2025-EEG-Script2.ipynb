    "The detection of noisy data and, in particular, noisy electrodes is an important step when preparing EEG for analysis.\n",
    "We can detect noisy electrodes by considering the following:\n",
    "- the amplitude of activity in the time-dependent signal\n",
    "- the region of the brain over which certain activity is concentrated. For example, we know that eye-blinks are characterised\n",
    "by positive-going activity over frontal electrodes of the right and left hemispheres.\n",
    "- by considering the frequency content of the electrode signals. High energy in the low frequency part of a spectrum indicates\n",
    "activity that is slow, often of high amplitude; activity very often related to movements.\n",
